    # Definition of management route providers which shall contribute routes to the management HTTP endpoint.
    # Management route providers should be regular extensions that aditionally extend the
    # `akka.management.scaladsl.ManagementRoutesProvider` or
    # `akka.management.javadsl.ManagementRoutesProvider` interface.
    #
    # Libraries may register routes into the management routes by defining entries to this setting
    # the library `reference.conf`:
    #
    # akka.management.http.routes {
    #   name = "FQCN"
    # }
    #
    # Where the `name` of the entry should be unique to allow different route providers to be registered
    # by different libraries and applications.
    #
    # The FQCN is the fully qualified class name of the `ManagementRoutesProvider`.
    #
    # By default the `akka.management.HealthCheckRoutes` is enabled, see `health-checks` section of how
    # configure specific readiness and liveness checks.
    #
    # Route providers included by a library (from reference.conf) can be excluded by an application
    # by using "" or null as the FQCN of the named entry, for example:
    #
    # akka.management.http.routes {
    #   health-checks = ""
    # }
    routes {
      health-checks = "akka.management.HealthCheckRoutes"

    # to adhere to this property

  }

  # Health checks for readiness and liveness
  health-checks {
    # When exposting health checks via Akka Management, the path to expost readiness checks on
    readiness-path = "ready"
    # When exposting health checks via Akka Management, the path to expost readiness checks on
    liveness-path = "alive"

    check-timeout = 1s
    # Add readiness and liveness checks to the below config objects with the synax:
    #
    # name = "FQCN"
    #
    # For example:
    #
    # cluster-membership = "akka.management.cluster.scaladsl.ClusterMembershipCheck"
    #
    # Libraries and frameworks that contribute checks are expected to add their own checks to their reference.conf.
    # Applications can add their own checks to application.conf.
