# Cluster HTTP Management

Akka Management Cluster HTTP is a Management extension that allows interaction with an `akka-cluster` through an HTTP interface.
This management extension exposes different operations to manage nodes in a cluster as well as health checks based
on the cluster state.

The operations exposed are comparable to the Command Line Management tool or the JMX interface `akka-cluster` provides.

## Project Info

@@project-info{ projectId="cluster-http" }

## Dependencies

The Akka Cluster HTTP Management is a separate jar file.
Make sure to include it along with the core akka-management library in your project:

@@dependency[sbt,Gradle,Maven] {
  symbol1=AkkaManagementVersion
  value1="$project.version$"
  group=com.lightbend.akka.management
  artifact=akka-management_$scala.binary.version$
  version=AkkaManagementVersion
  group2=com.lightbend.akka.management
  artifact2=akka-management-cluster-http_$scala.binary.version$
  version2=AkkaManagementVersion
}

Akka Cluster HTTP Management can be used with Akka $akka.version26$ or later.
You have to override the following Akka dependencies by defining them explicitly in your build and
define the Akka version to the one that you are using. Latest patch version of Akka is recommended and
a later version than $akka.version$ can be used.

@@dependency[sbt,Gradle,Maven] {
  symbol=AkkaVersion
  value=$akka.version$
  group=com.typesafe.akka
  artifact=akka-cluster-sharding_$scala.binary.version$
  version=AkkaVersion
  group2=com.typesafe.akka
  artifact2=akka-discovery
  version2=AkkaVersion
}

## Running

To make sure the Akka Cluster HTTP Management is running, register it with Akka Management:

Scala
:  @@snip [CompileOnlySpec.scala](/cluster-http/src/test/scala/doc/akka/cluster/http/management/CompileOnlySpec.scala) { #loading }

Java
:  @@snip [CompileOnlyTest.java](/cluster-http/src/test/java/jdoc/akka/cluster/http/management/CompileOnlyTest.java) { #loading }

## API Definition

The following table describes the usage of the API. All `GET` operations are exposed by default. `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE` operations
are only enabled if `akka.management.http.route-providers-read-only` is set to `false`.

| Path                         | HTTP method | Required form fields                 | Description
| ---------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -----------
| `/cluster/`                  | PUT         | operation: Prepare-for-full-shutdown | Executes a prepare for full shutdown operation in cluster.
| `/cluster/domain-events`     | GET         | None                                 | Returns cluster domain events as they occur, in JSON-encoded SSE format.
| `/cluster/members/`          | GET         | None                                 | Returns the status of the Cluster in JSON format.
| `/cluster/members/`          | POST        | address: `{address}`                 | Executes join operation in cluster for the provided `{address}`.
| `/cluster/members/{address}` | GET         | None                                 | Returns the status of `{address}` in the Cluster in JSON format.
| `/cluster/members/{address}` | DELETE      | None                                 | Executes leave operation in cluster for provided `{address}`.
| `/cluster/members/{address}` | PUT         | operation: Down                      | Executes down operation in cluster for provided `{address}`.
| `/cluster/members/{address}` | PUT         | operation: Leave                     | Executes leave operation in cluster for provided `{address}`.
| `/cluster/shards/{name}`     | GET         | None                                 | Returns shard info for the shard region with the provided `{name}`

The expected format of `address` follows the Cluster URI convention. Example: `akka://Main@myhostname.com:3311`

In the paths `address` is also allowed to be provided without the protocol prefix. Example: `Main@myhostname.com:3311`

## Hosting the routes in an existing Akka HTTP server

Starting `AkkaMangement` starts an Akka HTTP server and hosts the Cluster HTTP Routes. The routes can also be added
to an existing Akka HTTP server. To access all the routes:

Scala
:  @@snip [CompileOnlySpec.scala](/cluster-http/src/test/scala/doc/akka/cluster/http/management/CompileOnlySpec.scala) { #all }

Java
:  @@snip [CompileOnlyTest.java](/cluster-http/src/test/java/jdoc/akka/cluster/http/management/CompileOnlyTest.java) { #all }

Just the read only routes can be accessed:

Scala
:  @@snip [CompileOnlySpec.scala](/cluster-http/src/test/scala/doc/akka/cluster/http/management/CompileOnlySpec.scala) { #read-only }

Java
:  @@snip [CompileOnlyTest.java](/cluster-http/src/test/java/jdoc/akka/cluster/http/management/CompileOnlyTest.java) { #read-only }

## Disable routes

The Cluster HTTP Routes are included by default when this module is used. It can be disabled with the following
configuration, for example if the cluster membership health checks are to be included but not the other Cluster HTTP Routes.

```
akka.management.http.routes {
  cluster-management = ""
}
```

## Health checks

A cluster membership @ref:[health check](healthchecks.md) is included that is designed to be used as a readiness check.

By default the health check returns `true` when a node is either `Up` or `WeaklyUp`. Can be configured with `akka.management.cluster.health-checks.ready-states`.

The cluster membership readiness check can be disabled with configuration:

```
akka.management.health-checks.readiness-checks {
  cluster-membership = ""
}
```
