/**
 * The decision of joining "self" is made by deterministically sorting the discovered services
 * and picking the *lowest* address. Only the node with lowest address joins itself.
 *
 * If any of the contact-points returns a list of seed nodes it joins the existing cluster immediately.
 *
 * Joining "self" is only done when enough number of contact points have been discovered (`required-contact-point-nr`)
 * and there have been no changes to the discovered contact points during the `stable-margin`.
 *
 * There must also be seed node observations from all discovered contact points before joining "self".
