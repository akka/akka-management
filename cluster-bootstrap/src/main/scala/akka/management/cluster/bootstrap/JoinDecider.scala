 * (Akka Cluster addresses) that were returned from that contact point. That `Set` will be
 * empty if the node replied but is not part of an existing cluster yet, i.e. it hasn't joined.
 *
 * There are also some timestamps that can be interesting. Note that `currentTime` is passed in
 * to facilitate calculation of durations.
 *
 * `contactPointsChangedAt` is when the discovered contact points were last changed (e.g. via DNS lookup),
 * e.g. 5 seconds ago means that subsequent lookup attempts (1 per second) after that were successful and
 * returned the same set.
 *
 * `SeedNodesObservation.observedAt` was when that reply was received from that contact point.
 * The entry is removed if no reply was received within the `probing-failure-timeout` meaning that it
 * is unreachable or not running.
